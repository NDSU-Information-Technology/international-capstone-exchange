Any ideas how to better handle the cost field?  There are several options like a fixed cost, covering expenses, optional contribution, etc.
Deactivate a user
Display institution / country info to admins
Display cost/size/duration/effort in proposal grid view to users
Grey font should go away and become black
Institution edit page to update names

Pending departments are chooseable by new people. - Likely just get rid of departments
First time users can create a department and choose an existing one
Spell check on description - Using native browser option now, added note that to get to browser suggestions, must control right click.
Allow for editing of account info
Better country and institution listings (probably switch to datatable) - Switched to datatable, institutions has a bit of a painful load time
New account signup phone number entry and validation
New account signup email validation
Checkbox the subjects instead of using the pallette which is causing problems
Make page title obvious to admins
